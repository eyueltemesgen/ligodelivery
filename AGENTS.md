- Public backend URL and publishable key are baked into vite.config.ts `define` as a fallback, because published builds have shipped without VITE_* env vars and blanked the site.

## Customer Account Center
- Routes: `src/routes/account.*.tsx` (`/account`, `/account/orders`, `/account/orders/$orderId`, `/account/wishlist`, `/account/addresses`, `/account/profile`, `/account/notifications`, `/account/help`). Legacy `/orders`, `/orders/$orderId`, `/notifications` are redirect shims.
- Shell + nav: `src/components/account/AccountShell.tsx` (desktop sidebar, mobile horizontal pill nav). Shared async UI: `src/components/account/States.tsx`.
- Data layer: `src/lib/account.ts` (typed queries). Saved products/shops: `src/lib/saved.tsx` (tolerates missing `wishlist`/`shop_favorites` tables). Supabase error helpers: `src/lib/supa-error.ts`.
- Migrations are additive and idempotent: `supabase/migrations/20260908120000_account_center.sql` (addresses city/area/updated_at, single-default trigger, wishlist, shop_favorites, notifications).
- No local DB credentials. Migrations must be applied through Lovable/Supabase before dependent features work. Verify live functions before relying on them.
- `public.place_order` on the live DB had an unguarded `DELETE FROM _po_items;` (no WHERE) that Supabase safeupdate rejects; fix is `supabase/migrations/20260908130000_fix_place_order_safe_delete.sql` and must be applied for checkout to succeed.
- Address "set default" is also enforced client-side (clear other defaults before setting), so exactly one default holds even before the DB trigger migration is applied.

## Brand: የኔ Go (Yene Go)
- The platform was rebranded from "Ligo" to **የኔ Go** (English reference: Yene Go), tagline *Fast. Local. Delivered.*
- Internal identifiers are intentionally preserved for safety: routes, DB tables/columns, storage bucket `ligo-media`, CSS utilities `container-ligo`, theme localStorage key `ligo-theme`, and `src/components/ligo/*` paths. Do not rename these for cosmetic reasons.
- Live brand copy lives in `public.settings` key `site_content` (and `contact`). The read layer `src/lib/content.ts` normalizes legacy `Ligo*` values and placeholder `ligo` banners to the new brand so the UI is correct even before `supabase/migrations/20261003140000_rebrand_yene_go.sql` is applied. Applying that migration is still recommended.
- The header logo is an uploaded image (`site_content.logo_url`) rendered via `StorageImage`; the fallback wordmark/monogram is in `src/components/Logo.tsx`. Amharic glyphs rely on "Noto Sans Ethiopic", added as a fallback in `src/styles.css` and loaded from Google Fonts in `src/routes/__root.tsx`.
- Favicon/app icons live in `public/` (`favicon.ico`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`) with `public/manifest.webmanifest`.
